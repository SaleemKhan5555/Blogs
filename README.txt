Microservices Architecture
What are Micros Services
In software development domain, microservices is a new architectural approach in which a single application is composed of many small independent modules or services modeled around a business domain. In this approach each independent module or services is self-contained and implements a single business capability. It makes application easier to build, much easier to expand and scale.
Monoliths : A Traditional Approach 
Monolith approach is a traditional way of building enterprise applications which has become more complex as application gets expand. A monolithic application is built as a single unit contains all the code for all business activities an application performed. Enterprise Applications are built in three parts: a database (consisting of many tables usually in a relational database management system), a client-side user interface (consisting of HTML pages and/or JavaScript running in a browser), and a server-side application. This server-side application will handle HTTP requests, execute some domain-specific logic, retrieve and update data from the database, and populate the HTML views to be sent to the browser. It is a monolith â€“ a single logical executable. In a monolith, server side application logic, front end , client side logic, background jobs, etc, are all defined in the same massive code base. To make any modifications to the system developer will build and deploy the entire stack all at once.
